This Java program was created for Insight Data Engineering's
coding challenge for the Fall 2016 Fellowship Program.

It reads from "venmo-trans.txt" inside venmo_input and
writes to a file in venmo_output called "output.txt".
Both paths are hardcoded.

There are no dependencies on outside libraries.

Thanks for your time and consideration.
