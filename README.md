This Java program was created for Insight Data Engineering's
coding challenge for the Fall 2016 Fellowship Program.

Things to note: The path to the input file is hard coded.

So is the path to the output file.

I was unable to test the path to ensure that it is correct, 
but am positive that it should be the way it is.
With that being said, if the program crashes due to path issues,
please feel free to comment out the filewriter commands. 
I also included prints to console (in comments) to verify 
the correctness of the program in case the path is invalid. 
Feel free to uncommment and use it in your evaluation.

There are no dependencies on outside libraries.

Thanks for your time and consideration.
